## Weekly Workflow (Mon/Wed/Fri)
For each person, for each channel:
1) Choose 1 of the 7 base topics (channel already mapped).
2) Generate 3 concrete subtopics for Mon/Wed/Fri that are consistent with the base topic.
3) For each subtopic, create:
   - A short song concept (2–3 sentences).
   - A lyrical hook idea (1–2 lines).
   - A Suno style prompt (genre mix + instruments + tempo + vocal style).
   - Language choice from the variants.
   - Tone choice + education level.
4) Output in the template format below.

## Output Template (per channel per day)
- Channel ID + Name
- Base Topic
- Weekday Subtopic
- Language / Tone / Education Level
- Song Concept (2–3 sentences)
- Hook (1–2 lines)
- Suno Prompt (genre + instruments + vocal style + bpm + production descriptors)
- Lyrics (full)

## Constraints
- Integrate topic, language, and genre so they feel coherent.
- Johannes: poetic, spiritually reflective, crafted, honest, often metaphorical.
- Daniel: culturally grounded, catchy, relatable, a bit humorous, mainstream friendly.
- Avoid offensive or exclusive content; keep values-based and respectful.
